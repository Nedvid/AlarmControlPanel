# AlarmControlPanel [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Plytirex/AlarmControlPanel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Plytirex/AlarmControlPanel)

Alarm Control Panel is academic project written in C++ for Basics of Microprocessors
Technology Lab, which was created by three people. It uses STM32F4-Disovery board
together with STM32CubeF4 firmware and FreeRTOS. 

ACP is still in alpha stage, take a look into
[issue section](https://github.com/Plytirex/AlarmControlPanel/issues),
to see what needs tweaking.

Currently it supports LCD screen with user interface controlled by membrane keyboard,
up to 4 PIRs, httpserver with partial GET method support, local time with dedicated
python server for time synchronization and Web Control Panel (which is not currently
bundled, due to issue #13 .

## 1. BUILD ##
Project uses linux-only Makefile, so basic linux envoirnment (mkdir, rm, sed) is
recommeded. For building std::experimental::any library is needed. GCC since
version 5.1.0 is known to work. Check your compiler's documentation, if you would
like to use the other one.

### 1.1. Clone repo and submodules ###

    git clone https://github.com/Plytirex/AlarmControlPanel
    git submodule update --init
    

### 1.2. Release version: ###

    make depends && make release
    

### 1.3. Debug version: ###
Debug version uses semehosting to print additional debug info using C `printf`, 
which in addition slows program significantly. Openocd server started with `arm
semihosting enable` is needed to enable semihosting. Debug build **can't be used**
without semihosting server â€“ otherwise the program will hang on first printf.

    make depends && make debug
